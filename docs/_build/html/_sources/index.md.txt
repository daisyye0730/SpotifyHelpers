## Overview
Some tasks that it performs include:

1. process_user_profile_pic: extracts user profile picture given its html

2. get_public_playlists_albums: extracts all public playlist album covers from a user's html page 

3. get_individual_album_covers_from_mosaic: extracts four individual cover photos from a mosaic cover photo

4. get_playlist_profile_pic: extracts the profile picture from a playlist 

5. process_artist_album: extracts all the album covers of an artist 

6. make_request: accepts a html string and requests a session with the html with a response code 

7. get_soup: accepts the return object from make_request and parses into content acceptable in tasks 1-5

8. filter_all_other_color: gets rid of all the color (BGR) that is not within a certain range and save those that are 

9. filter_this_color: filters the color (BGR) within a specific range and save those that aren't 

10. smooth_img: smoothes and blurs the image. Without the parameter threshold, it will default to (5, 5)

11. return_most_common_color: returns the most common color (BGR) and its count in a picture 

12. overlay_two_images: overlays two images with the same size on top of each other. Can change the weight of each image.

## Examples 
1. get_soup(make_request('https://open.spotify.com/user/rosycarina')) will return the BeautifulSoup object from a html page 
NOTE: make_request is similar to get_soup's helper function 

2. process_user_profile_pic(get_soup(make_request('https://open.spotify.com/user/rosycarina'))) will return the user profile picture 

3. get_public_playlists_albums(get_soup(make_request('https://open.spotify.com/user/rosycarina'))) will return all the album covers of the user's public playlists

4. get_individual_album_covers_from_mosaic('https://mosaic.scdn.co/300/ab67616d00001e022a6ab83ec179747bc3b190dcab67616d00001e02335534788cbc39cfd23ee993ab67616d00001e02d6df3bccf3ec41ea2f76debcab67616d00001e02f0855ff71aa79ab842164fc6') will return the four individual images from this mosaic image 
NOTE: the length of the mosaic image link has to be 160, because each individual image is consisted of 40 characters (without the heading). So four images should be 160. 

5. get_playlist_profile_pic(get_soup(make_request('https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6snlZhdBpJK0cxYURvqhFU?si=8e7eb1f3db5f438b&nd=1'))) will return the profile pic of this playlist

6. process_artist_album(get_soup(make_request('https://open.spotify.com/artist/06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02'))) will return all the artist albums on the artist page.

7. filter_all_other_color("SpotifyPictureHelper/tests/test2.png", (0, 0, 0), (25, 25, 25)) leaves the image with pixels that fall between (0, 0, 0) and (25, 25, 25)

8. filter_this_color("SpotifyPictureHelper/tests/test2.png", (0, 0, 0), (25, 25, 25)) filters all pixels that fall between (0, 0, 0) and (25, 25, 25)

9. smooth_img("SpotifyPictureHelper/tests/test2.png") will smooth the image with the kernel size (5,5)

10. return_most_common_color("SpotifyPictureHelper/tests/test2.png") will return the most common color in this image file 

11. overlay_two_images("SpotifyPictureHelper/tests/test2.png", "SpotifyPictureHelper/tests/blackWhite.png", 0.5, 0.5) will return a blended image with the first image weighing 50% and the second image weighing also 50%
