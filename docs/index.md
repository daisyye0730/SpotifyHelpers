## Examples 
1. get_soup(make_request('https://open.spotify.com/user/rosycarina')) will return the BeautifulSoup object from a html page 
NOTE: make_request is similar to get_soup's helper function 

2. process_user_profile_pic(get_soup(make_request('https://open.spotify.com/user/rosycarina'))) will return the user profile picture 

3. get_public_playlists_albums(get_soup(make_request('https://open.spotify.com/user/rosycarina'))) will return all the album covers of the user's public playlists

4. get_individual_album_covers_from_mosaic('https://mosaic.scdn.co/300/ab67616d00001e022a6ab83ec179747bc3b190dcab67616d00001e02335534788cbc39cfd23ee993ab67616d00001e02d6df3bccf3ec41ea2f76debcab67616d00001e02f0855ff71aa79ab842164fc6') will return the four individual images from this mosaic image 
NOTE: the length of the mosaic image link has to be 160, because each individual image is consisted of 40 characters (without the heading). So four images should be 160. 

5. get_playlist_profile_pic(get_soup(make_request('https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6snlZhdBpJK0cxYURvqhFU?si=8e7eb1f3db5f438b&nd=1'))) will return the profile pic of this playlist

6. process_artist_album(get_soup(make_request('https://open.spotify.com/artist/06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02'))) will return all the artist albums on the artist page.
